This are the new abilities for the player

First, attach the "Player_AbilityBehaviour"
to the player and pass the reference to the
character controller and gravity.

Second, you will see that there is a drop
down menu where ability prefabs are needed
those are in the "Ability Modules" folder

In code you can grant the player an ability,
nothing happens if the player doesnt have an
ability anyway. The code in "Player_AbilityBehaviour" is
"SetAbility(ability)" and
the argument is any of the abilities in the
"AbilityReferences" variable

If any of the stats for the abilities does not
convince you, you can modify the values in the
"Ability Modules" folder which contains 6 prefabs
for abilities.

Last but not least, if you need to modify the button
that activates the abilities in code, you can do so with
"AbilitySelected.AbilityCustomizeKey(KeyCode key)"
in any of the "AbilityBase" type class, but
first you got to call "SetAbility" before anything
if you approach by code, but you can also modify the
ability key by modifying the prefab in "Ability Modules"
I recommend leaving the keys as they are in both jetpack
